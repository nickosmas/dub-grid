### F-18 [P3] fixed - The live MFA-policy integration test can lose its verified session under full-suite load

**File:** `apps/web/src/__tests__/mfa-enforced-in-policies.integration.test.ts:110`
**Found:** 2026-09-25 during 41b3's final gate (full `npm run test`)
**Why it matters:** The challenge verify returned no session once in a full run and passed in isolation (1/1). A TOTP window rollover or local Auth rate limit under parallel live tests are the likely causes; unproven.
**Suggested fix:** Generate the code for the verify moment and retry once on a window edge, or run the live tests serially.
**Resolution:** Seen again 2026-09-28 in a full `test:web` and passing alone. Fixed with the owner's approval (fix/mfa-policy-test-flake): the test answers the challenge through `answerChallenge`, which waits out a TOTP window edge before computing the code and, if the answer is refused, retries once in the next window with a fresh code. A second refusal fails with the auth server's error. It passed three runs in a row alone.

### F-62 [P2] fixed - Turning on `secure_password_change` would refuse password changes for two-factor users on sessions older than a day

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/account/client/step-up.ts:44`; `apps/mobile/src/features/profile/lib/step-up.ts:62`; `supabase/config.toml` (`secure_password_change = true`)
**Found:** 2026-09-26 during 41d3's production Auth review
**Why it matters:** Supabase Auth v2.187.0 (`internal/api/user.go:154`) refuses a password update without a reauthentication nonce when the current session started more than 24 hours ago. DubGrid's password step-up replaces the session, so it passes; its authenticator-code step-up keeps the old session, and neither app sends a nonce. Mobile sessions now last until sign-out, so with the setting on, a two-factor user could not change their password on mobile after the first day. Production has it off; local `config.toml` has it on, which the fresh sessions in tests never reach.
**Suggested fix:** Keep it off in production. Before turning it on, either send Supabase's reauthentication nonce with the update or have the authenticator-code step-up issue a fresh session; then set local and production alike.
**Resolution:** Fixed on fix/password-change-fresh-session, the owner's call being "pick the best decision" (2026-09-28): turn it on safely. A signed-in change (web and mobile) always signs in again first, with the current password and, for a two-factor account, its code, which the server answers on the new session. So every change runs on a brand-new session that `secure_password_change` accepts. Route and component tests cover the right, wrong and missing code, and the old code fails them. Still to do: turn the setting on in production once this code is released.

### F-75 [P3] fixed - Database functions still let a stale Gridmaster token edit organization data

**File:** `supabase/migrations` (`check_admin_permission_for_org`, `is_authorized_org`, `publish_schedule` and the schedule, recurring and request functions that use them; `start_impersonation`; `force_logout_user`)
**Found:** 2026-09-26 while building 41d6
**Why it matters:** These SECURITY DEFINER functions are granted to `authenticated` and authorize a Gridmaster with `is_gridmaster()` alone, so a stale or stolen Gridmaster token can still edit schedules, publish, and settle requests in any organization by calling them through the data API. `start_impersonation` called directly also starts a session and its in-app notices without the route's audit row and email notice, and `force_logout_user` is gated in its route but not in the database. They are also how impersonated edits work, through routes that do not ask for fresh proof.
**Suggested fix:** A decision for the owner. Requiring `caller_has_fresh_proof()` for a Gridmaster in those checks closes it, but a Gridmaster editing schedules while impersonating would then be asked to confirm their identity every five minutes, and the schedule screens would need the step-up prompt wired in. Alternatively accept it: grants of authority and direct table writes are already closed (051 to 054).
**Resolution:** Narrowed by the owner's choice (2026-09-26, 41d7): migration 055 gives `start_impersonation` and `force_logout_user` the 051 guard, the impersonation route asks for fresh proof before a start (never before an end) and answers a database refusal with the prompt, and the portal runs the start through step-up; live tests prove both refuse a stale Gridmaster, work with fresh proof, and that a stale token still ends a session. Still open: the schedule, recurring, publish and request functions, left unchanged on purpose because fresh proof there would interrupt impersonated editing. Not accepted by the owner (2026-09-28), who also didn't want five-minute prompts. Fixed on fix/gridmaster-writes-need-impersonation: migration 075 binds a Gridmaster's authority over an organization's schedule, recurring, request, publish and job-override functions to an active impersonation of that organization, started by the same auth session. `requireOrgPermissions` applies the same rule to every write in those routes and to settings changes. The live test covers outside, inside, ended, expired and other-session impersonations, a non-Gridmaster, and the unguarded bodies' grants. It also found and fixed a NULL in the two org helpers that would have let the change fall through.

### F-78 [P3] fixed - A mobile sign-in that outlives the app's request timeout leaves an orphan server session

**File:** `apps/mobile` sign-in request (15 s client timeout); `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
**Found:** 2026-09-26 during the 41d3 Android rehearsal
**Why it matters:** On a slow server (18.6 s observed under load) the phone gives up while the server finishes, so a session is created that the phone never receives, and Security lists an extra signed-in device until it is revoked or expires.
**Suggested fix:** End the created session when the client has gone (for example, a short server-side deadline that signs the new session out), or let the next successful sign-in on that device replace the orphan.
**Resolution:** Fixed in f3eb3fe0 (fix/mobile-login-orphan-session), taking the first option. The mobile login handler is `apps/web/src/features/mobile/server/routes/auth-login.ts`, not the web route the finding names. Past `MOBILE_LOGIN_SERVER_DEADLINE_MS` (the client timeout less one second), or once `req.signal` reports the client gone, it ends the session it just created and answers 504 rather than returning tokens nobody is waiting for; returning them is what leaves the orphan, so the two are decided together. The ending is `endUserSession` with the user and session ids read back from the token just minted, never a `signOut` on the ephemeral client, whose default global scope would sign the person out on every device. Cleanup is best effort and its outcome is recorded as `sessionDiscarded`, since a sign-in already too slow to use must not also fail on tidying up. `MOBILE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` moved into `@dubgrid/contracts` because the server has to stay under the client's value and two copies would drift. The handler now changes a session, so `MOBILE_DELEGATES` classifies it with assertions pinning that the only session it can end is the one it just created for that request; a sensitive-action gate would be circular on the endpoint that mints the caller's first token (the findings session agreed). Three route tests cover the abandoned sign-in, a cleanup failure still answering 504, and a normal sign-in ending nothing. Not verified against a real slow server: the 18.6 s case came from a loaded Android rehearsal and was not reproduced.

### F-121 [P3] unverified - Latent inventory parser traps

**File:** `scripts/documentation/inventory.ts:531` (`resolveSourceModule`), walk helpers; `scripts/documentation/check.ts:84`
**Found:** 2026-09-28 by `/audit` (scope: current, 1b86aad5..1cc2be3e; all lenses)
**Why it matters:** each needs a real source to trigger it: an `@/` import in Settings would make the digest read a nonexistent path and crash; a `page.tsx` or `route.ts` under a Next private (`_x`) or `@slot` folder would count as a route; `statSync` follows symlinks, so a loop recurses; untracked local files feed the inventory, so `docs:check` can fail locally but pass in CI; with no `.gitattributes`, a CRLF checkout fails frontmatter parsing and the byte compare.
**Suggested fix:** resolve aliases through tsconfig paths, skip private and slot folders, walk with `lstat` and skip links, and add `* text=auto eol=lf` for the generated and docs files.
**Resolution:**

### F-122 [P3] unverified - The env-module declaration pattern could count any uppercase object key

**File:** `scripts/documentation/inventory.ts` (`discoverEnvironmentKeys`, schema-property match)
**Found:** 2026-09-28 by `/audit` (re-review of F-115 on feature/40a-docs-inventory)
**Why it matters:** in an `env.*` module every indented `UPPER_CASE:` key is recorded as a declared environment key, not only properties of the Zod schema. Every current match is a real schema key, so nothing is wrong today; a lookup table with uppercase keys in an env module would add phantom keys that then fail classification.
**Suggested fix:** read keys only from the object literal passed to `z.object(...)` (the TypeScript AST the route parser already uses), or accept the unclassified-key failure as the guard.
**Resolution:**

### F-123 [P3] open - Metro's image-size copies stay vulnerable until the Expo SDK upgrade

**File:** `package-lock.json` (`apps/mobile/node_modules/expo/node_modules/@expo/metro/node_modules/metro/node_modules/image-size`, and the copy under `react-native > @react-native/community-cli-plugin > metro`); Dependabot alerts 193, 194
**Found:** 2026-09-28 while clearing the open Dependabot alerts
**Why it matters:** image-size 1.2.1 loops forever on a crafted ICNS, JXL or HEIF file (GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr, GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq). Metro uses it only to measure the app's own image assets during a bundle, so the exposure is a stalled build on a developer machine or in CI, not the shipped app or the web server. The fixed 2.0.3 is a major that measures only a buffer, while Metro 0.83.3 passes a file path, so an override would break every image asset; `@expo/metro` 54.2.0 pins metro 0.83.3 exactly, and metro 0.83.8, which drops image-size, is not taken by SDK 54. Moving only the React Native copy to 0.83.8 would leave the alert open through Expo's copy.
**Suggested fix:** Take the next Expo SDK (its `@expo/metro` moves to metro 0.84), then drop the image-size entry from `scripts/audit-check.mjs`. Until then the allowlist entry holds, review by 2026-11-01.
**Resolution:**

### F-124 [P3] open - No upstream path clears decode-uri-component 0.2.2 in the mobile app

**File:** `package-lock.json` (`query-string` 7.1.3 under `expo-router` and `@react-navigation/native > @react-navigation/core`); Dependabot alert 174
**Found:** 2026-09-28 while clearing the open Dependabot alerts
**Why it matters:** decode-uri-component 0.2.2 decodes malformed percent-encoded input exponentially (fixed in 0.5.0). It ships in the mobile app, where it parses the app's own deep links, so the only trigger is a crafted link opened on the user's own device, which stalls that app. query-string 7 `require()`s it as CommonJS, and 0.5.0 is ESM-only, so an override would break link parsing; even the newest expo-router (57.x) still depends on query-string ^7.1.3.
**Suggested fix:** Revisit when expo-router and React Navigation move to query-string 9.5 or later (which depends on decode-uri-component ^0.5.0), normally with an Expo SDK upgrade. Medium severity, below the `deps:audit` gate, so no allowlist entry is needed.
**Resolution:**

### F-125 [P3] open - Vitest's mocker advisory needs the Vitest 4 major

**File:** `package.json` (`vitest` ^3.2.7, `@vitest/coverage-v8` ^3.2.7) and each workspace's Vitest config; Dependabot alerts 185, 186
**Found:** 2026-09-28 while clearing the open Dependabot alerts
**Why it matters:** `@vitest/mocker`'s redirect mock can read files outside the project (path traversal), fixed only in 4.1.11; every 3.x release is in range. Vitest runs only on developer machines and in CI over this repo's own tests, so the exposure is a crafted test or mock path in a change we review.
**Suggested fix:** Upgrade `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` to 4.1.11 or later in one change across web, mobile and the packages, following Vitest's 4.0 migration notes, and run every workspace's suite. Medium severity, below the `deps:audit` gate.
**Resolution:**

### F-126 [P3] open - Faker's code-execution advisory waits on @snaplet/copycat

**File:** `package-lock.json` (`node_modules/@snaplet/copycat/node_modules/@faker-js/faker` 8.4.1); `scripts/audit-check.mjs` allowlist; Dependabot alert 175
**Found:** 2026-09-28 while clearing the open Dependabot alerts
**Why it matters:** `faker.helpers.fake()` evaluates its template (GHSA-qxc2-j82w-r537, fixed in 10.5.0). Faker arrives only through the seed tooling (`@snaplet/seed` > `@snaplet/copycat`), whose templates we write, and nothing calls `helpers.fake` with outside input. copycat 6.0.0 is still its newest release and pins faker ^8.4.1, two majors below the fix.
**Suggested fix:** Take a copycat release on faker 10.5 or later when one ships, or replace the seed data generator. The allowlist entry holds until 2026-12-01.
**Resolution:**
